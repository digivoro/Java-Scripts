#Incremental Development

- Start with a working program and make small, incremental changes. At any point, if there is an error, you will know where to look.
- Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can check them, either with print statements or by using a debugger.
- Once the program is working, you can consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions (but only if it does not make the program more difficult to read).
